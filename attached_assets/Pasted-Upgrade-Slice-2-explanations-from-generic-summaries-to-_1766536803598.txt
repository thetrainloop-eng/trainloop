Upgrade Slice 2 explanations from generic summaries to SPECIFIC, evidence-based change explanations for MODIFIED documents.

Current issue:
Explanations say “content changed” but do not identify what specifically changed. We need TrainLoop to state concrete changes for the hypothetical company based on the actual text differences.

Requirements:
1) For MODIFIED changes where we have previousContent and newContent (Google Docs), compute a real text diff and generate a structured explanation from that diff.
2) Output must be evidence-based: every described change must include short BEFORE and AFTER excerpts from the text (<= 30 words each). No invented facts.
3) Provide 3–8 concrete change items max, prioritizing the most important changes (requirements, responsibilities, timelines, thresholds, steps, prohibitions).
4) Produce a final plain-English “What changed / Why it matters / Recommended actions” but the “What changed” section MUST be populated from those concrete diff items.
5) If we cannot confidently locate changes (e.g., content too large or diff fails), degrade gracefully: say “Could not isolate exact edits; here are the top sections that changed” with evidence excerpts.
6) Keep existing provider abstraction (ExplanationGenerator interface). Only improve internals/prompting + add diff helper.

Implementation approach (minimal, practical):
- Add a diff helper for text:
  - Split content into paragraphs or lines (e.g., by blank lines or '\n').
  - Use a lightweight diff algorithm/library if already installed; if not, implement a simple LCS or use 'diff' npm package.
  - Produce a list of changed chunks (added/removed/modified) with surrounding context.
  - Limit to top N chunks by size/importance.
- Pass these diff chunks to the AI instead of the entire documents when possible:
  - Provide documentName, changeType, severity
  - Provide a “diffChunks” array like:
    [{type, before, after, contextHeadingGuess}]
- Prompt MUST require JSON output with concrete items and evidence.

New required JSON output schema for MODIFIED:
{
  "title": string,
  "change_items": [
    {
      "change_type": "added"|"removed"|"modified",
      "location": string|null,
      "before_excerpt": string|null,
      "after_excerpt": string|null,
      "plain_english_change": string,
      "why_it_matters": string,
      "recommended_action": string,
      "confidence": "low"|"medium"|"high"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "what_changed": string[],
    "why_it_matters": string[],
    "recommended_actions": string[]
  },
  "overall_confidence": "low"|"medium"|"high"
}

Dashboard:
- Keep rendering as-is, but update it to show “change_items” under WHAT CHANGED (bullets), and optionally show before/after excerpts in a collapsible details area.

Acceptance test:
- Edit one realistic policy paragraph (e.g., change a timeline, add a required approval step, alter escalation procedure).
- After ingestion, the explanation must mention the specific change with before/after excerpts and a location/section if possible.

Deliverables:
- List files changed.
- Show example explanation JSON produced for a real modified doc from the test folder.
- Keep changes small, avoid refactors.
