We have working ingestion + change detection (CREATED / MODIFIED / RENAMED). Now implement FOUR MVP enhancements with minimal diffs and without breaking existing endpoints/dashboard:

1) Deletion detection
- If a document previously tracked in our DB for the configured folder is missing from the current Drive folder listing, record a changeType = 'deleted'.
- Update document state accordingly (e.g., mark deletedAt or isDeleted=true). Do NOT hard-delete rows.
- IMPORTANT: treat “moved out of folder” as deleted (since we only list one folder). If it reappears later, treat as created again unless we explicitly support move detection.

2) Initial ingestion suppression (“baseline run”)
- On the FIRST ingestion run for a folder, do not generate a flood of CREATED changes.
- Instead, mark the run as baseline and store documents in DB with their hashes/versions, but create either:
  a) zero change records, OR
  b) one summary change record like "Baseline established: N documents indexed"
- Define “first run” as: no prior ingestion run exists for that folder OR no documents exist in DB for that folder. Choose the simplest reliable condition.

3) Attach change reason details
- For every change record (created/modified/renamed/deleted), include a structured JSON "reason" object that explains why it was classified that way.
- For MODIFIED: reason should indicate whether it was contentChanged, nameChanged, metadataChanged, etc.
- For RENAMED: include oldName and newName.
- For DELETED: include lastSeenAt and lastKnownName.
- Keep existing dashboard response shape unchanged, but you may ADD optional fields safely. If dashboard shows only summary text now, keep it working.

4) Change severity heuristic
- Add a severity field to change records: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
- Heuristic (MVP-simple):
  - renamed => low
  - deleted => medium (or high if you prefer; pick one and be consistent)
  - created => medium
  - modified:
      - if contentChanged => high
      - if only metadata/nameChanged => low
- If we can detect contentChanged vs metadataChanged, use it. Otherwise default modified => high.

Technical constraints:
- Minimal changes, no broad refactor.
- Do NOT change existing API routes; only extend payload fields if needed.
- If using SQLite, add any required schema changes (e.g., new columns) and provide a safe dev approach:
  - either ALTER TABLE migrations or note that dev DB can be recreated.
- Concurrency protection must remain intact (no overlapping runs).
- Add concise logging for: baseline run decision, deletion detection counts, and reasons.

Acceptance tests to verify (must pass):
A) Baseline: fresh DB + run ingestion -> documents saved, but no CREATED spam (or a single baseline summary record).
B) Rename a tracked doc -> RENAMED with reason {oldName,newName} and severity low.
C) Edit Google Doc text -> MODIFIED with reason {contentChanged:true} and severity high.
D) Delete/move a tracked file out of folder -> DELETED with reason and severity medium/high.
E) Next ingestion after deletion with no further changes -> no new change records.

Deliverables:
- List exact files changed and summarize DB/schema changes.
- Show example changeRecord objects for each type (created/modified/renamed/deleted) including reason + severity.
